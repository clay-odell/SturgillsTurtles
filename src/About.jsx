      <p>
        <strong>Sturgill's Turtles</strong> is a rock and roll cover band based
        out of Huntsville, Alabama. Made up of members Matt Michael, Gus
        Hergert, and Clay O'Dell, Sturgill's band took their name from the
        country singer, but their musical influences span everything from
        classic country, 90s rock, to improvisational music like Phish, Grateful
        Dead, and Widespread Panic.
